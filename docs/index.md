__Saber__ (__S__equence __A__nnotator for __B__iomedical __E__ntities and __R__elations) is a deep-learning based tool for __information extraction__ in the biomedical domain.

The neural network model used is a BiLSTM-CRF [[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01360), [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01354)]; a state-of-the-art architecture for sequence labelling. The model is implemented using [Keras](https://keras.io/).

Pull requests are welcome! If you encounter any bugs, please open an issue in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/BaderLab/saber).
