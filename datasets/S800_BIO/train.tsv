three	O
possibilities	O
for	O

the	O

detect	O

However	O

studies	O
have	O
shown	O
effects	O
on	O
smaller	O
spatial	O

and	O
temporal	O

scales	O

Second	O
,	O
priority	O
effects	O
may	O
be	O
important	O
in	O
the	O
successful	O

F	B-LIVB

aquilonia	I-LIVB

Thirdly	O
,	O
boreal	O
ant	O
assemblages	O
may	O
be	O
too	O
depauperate	O
for	O
redundancy	O
in	O
ecological	O
roles	O
and	O
for	O

to	O
play	O
