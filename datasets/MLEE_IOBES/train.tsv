In	O

Harold	O

to	O

that	O

that	O

characteristic	O
of	O

In	O

Dvorak	O
went	O
on	O
to	O
demonstrate	O
that	O
VPF	O
was	O
secreted	S-Localization
by	O
a	O
variety	O
of	O

proposed	O
that	O

in	O

for	O
the	O

seen	O
in	O
human	O

As	O
a	O
result	O

he	O

was	O
capable	O
of	O
stimulating	S-Positive_regulation

growth	S-Cell_proliferation
and	O
angiogenesis	S-Blood_vessel_development
.	O

These	O
fundamental	O
discoveries	O
led	O
to	O
additional	O
research	O
conducted	O
by	O
Napoleone	O

In	O

Dvorak	O
proposed	O
that	O
by	O
secreting	S-Localization

,	O
tumors	O
induce	S-Positive_regulation

by	O
turning	O

He	O
noted	O
that	O
wounds	O

like	O
tumors	O
,	O
secrete	S-Localization
VPF	O
,	O
causing	O
blood	O

to	O
leak	S-Localization
plasma	O
fibrinogen	O
,	O
which	O
stimulates	S-Positive_regulation

vessel	O
growth	S-Growth
and	O
provides	O
a	O
matrix	O
on	O
which	O
they	O
can	O
spread	O
.	O

Unlike	O
wounds	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
that	O
turn	B-Negative_regulation
off	E-Negative_regulation
VPF	O
production	S-Gene_expression
after	O
healing	O
,	O
tumors	O
did	O
not	O
turn	B-Negative_regulation
off	E-Negative_regulation
their	O
VPF	O
production	S-Gene_expression
and	O
instead	O
continued	O
to	O
make	S-Gene_expression
large	O
amounts	O
of	O
VPF	O
,	O
allowing	O
malignant	O
cells	O
to	O
continue	O
to	O
induce	S-Positive_regulation
new	O
blood	O

and	O
so	O
to	O
grow	S-Cell_proliferation
